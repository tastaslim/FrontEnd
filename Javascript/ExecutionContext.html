//By default, any variable of function which is not inside anything(class,
function, obj ...), // they are in global execution context // But as soon as
the function or class or etc. started executing their code, they get their
exection context // and now anything written inside that function or class or
etc. executes in the corresponding execution context // of that function, class
or etc. // Execution stack also known as calling stack, is a LIFO type which is
used to store all the execution contexts when code of a given .js file executes.
